Just want to put together a quick and dirty slideshow, using remotely hosted images?

Format:

http://<your site>/<folder containing UNITY HTML, Javascript etc.>?remote=y&slideint=1300&imgs=<image1:  URL encoded web address of image including http://>~~<image2:  URL encoded web address of image including http://>~~<image3: URL encoded web address of image including http://>&info=<URL encoded text to display when info button is touched>

To manually encode URLs or Info text, use: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/

or..use the ScreenBase unity_slideshow_create module to encode everything for you. This will work locally by running Create's index.html or try it at:

Working example of a slideshow (with remotely hosted images) from the 'Screens in the Wild'installation of UNITY Slideshow:
